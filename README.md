# Heart_Disease_ML
A Machine Learning model predicting if a patient is at risk of having Heart Disease or not.

Project Description:
St Stephen’s Hospital and Maternity is a private owned hospital located in Lagos, Nigeria. It was founded in 1972 by an astute medical professional. The hospital provides a wide range of medical services, including but not limited to general medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology. The Hospital is known for its state-of-the-art facilities, modern equipment, and highly skilled medical professionals. 
It was then observed that an increasing number of patients presented themselves with complains including chest pains, blood pressure related issues, cholesterol level declines and stroke in some cases,  hence an inquiry into the possibility of patients being at risk of a heart disease. 

Objective:
This project is aimed at determining if a patient with certain symptoms is at risk of having a Heart Disease or not using machine learning models.

Data Dictionary /Description:
The heart disease dataset is a CSV file containing 5508 records and 12 columns, including the target variable of patient’s data. The features include Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure (RestingBP), Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar (FastingBS), Resting Electrocardiographic results (RestingECG), Maximum Heart Rate achieved (MaxHR), Exercise-induced Angina (ExerciseAngina), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (Oldpeak), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (ST_Slope).

Methodology:
I performed an exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and determine the relationship between the factors affecting the features and their outcomes, made predictions using different machine learning algorithms, and identified patients at risk of a heart disease. The machine learning algorithm explored included Logstic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, LGBMClassifier, XGBoostClassifier and DecsionTreeClassifier. The Random Forest Classifier performed better with an Accuracy (100%), Precision (100%), Recall (100%) compared to other classifiers with equally high accuracy level.
